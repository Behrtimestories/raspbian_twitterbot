# raspbian_twitterbot - Interactive and automated end user scripts for Twython on Raspbian

This is a super simple pack of scripts designed to allow both interactive and automated tweets based on user criteria. 

Current version is 0.0.1
January 20, 2019

If Twython is installed and working, all scripts should work without modification

Should. 

## Obtaining

Clone the repo to the appropriate local path. 
https://github.com/Behrtimestories/raspbian_twitterbot

## Configuration

Copy "auth.simple" to "auth.py" and add the appropriate access tokens.

## Usage

Invote any script and follow the prompts. Interactive scripts begin with "interactive," automatic scripts begin with "automatic"

Good luck!
